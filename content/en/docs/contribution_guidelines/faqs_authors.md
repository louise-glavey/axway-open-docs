## FAQs for authors

The following are some common questions about developing **Axway** product documentation in a _docs-as-code_ workflow.

### What is the docs-as-code approach?

Documentation as code (docs-as-code) refers to a philosophy that you should write documentation with the same tools as are used to write code. The approach often keeps to the following guidelines:

* You create tickets to track your work in an issue-tracking tool, such as Jira.
* You create and edit documentation a plain text markup language, such as Markdown and Asciidoc.
* You use a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
* Files are tracked in a version control tool, such as GitHub.

### Do I need to install anything before I can contribute to the documentation?

There is a list of prerequisite steps that you must complete. For more information, see the [Contribution guidelines](/docs/contribution_guidelines/#before-you-start).
